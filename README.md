# Data Engineering Coding Challenge

## Description
The code in the repository presents an approach or solution to the different data engineering challenges presented in the corresponding document v1.

## Contents

- `task1_1.py` - Task 1 of Part 1
- `task1_2.py` - Task 2 of Part 1
- `task1_3.py` - Task 3 of Part 1
- `task2_1.py` - Task 1 of Part 2
- `task2_2.py` - Task 2 of Part 2
- `task2_3.py` - Task 3 of Part 2
- `task2_4.py` - Task 4 of Part 2
- `task2_5.py` - Task 5 of Part 2
- `task3_1.py` - Task 1 of Part 3
- `task3_2.py` - Task 2 of Part 3

## Language
- Python

## Environment
- Apache Spark
- All code has been developed and tested using [Databricks CE](https://community.cloud.databricks.com) and
[Jupyter Notebook Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) on a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/all-spark-notebook)

## Instructions
The code for every part is independent of the rest and can be run separately, however the tasks within every part must be run in order.
A notebook `de_challenge_on_databricks.ipynb` with all the code is also provided.
